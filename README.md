## Overview

A neatly arranged testimonials grid layout featuring five user cards with unique styles. This challenge helped me practice **CSS Grid**, **custom theming**, and adaptive design using **media queries**. Each testimonial is structured with semantic HTML and styled for mobile and desktop responsiveness.
